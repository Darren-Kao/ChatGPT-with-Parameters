Roses are red, violets are blue
My love for you is ever so true
From the day that we met
My heart you did get
My love for you will never be through

It's a blessing to have you in my life, my dove

My heart is filled with love and cheer
I'm so lucky to have you, it's true

Prompt: Would you rather be able to see 10 minutes into the future or 100 years into the future?

Response:
As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or desires. However, I can provide a logical perspective on this question.

If we consider the practicality of the two options, seeing 10 minutes into the future would be more useful in our daily lives. It would help us make better decisions in the short term, such as avoiding accidents or making timely decisions in business or personal matters.

On the other hand, seeing 100 years into the future would be more intriguing, but it may not be practically useful for us as individuals. It would be interesting to see how the world evolves over time, but we may not be able to use that information to make better decisions in our present lives.

Therefore, it depends on what you value more - practicality or curiosity.

Response:

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was an important international organization in the late 20th century that worked to promote peace and security in Europe and beyond. The OSCE was established in 1975 as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki, Finland. It was a forum for dialogue and negotiation between the East and West during the Cold War. The OSCE was a key player in the negotiation of the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), which helped reduce the risk of war in Europe. The OSCE also played a major role in the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In addition, the OSCE has monitored elections, provided conflict resolution assistance, and monitored human rights in its member states.

Verse 1
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

Chorus
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Verse 2
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

Chorus
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Bridge
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry

Prompt: write a song with lyrics 'your heart is aching but you're too shy to say it'

Response:


Verse 1
Your heart is aching but you're too shy to say it
You keep it hidden and you don't know why
You try to ignore it but it's still there
You keep it bottled up inside

Chorus
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
You want to tell someone but you can't find the words
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
But you're too shy to say it

Verse 2
You try to push it away but it won't go
It's like an anchor that's dragging you down
You try to be strong but it's hard to do
When your heart is aching inside

Chorus
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
You want to tell someone but you can't find the words
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
But you're too shy to say it

Bridge
You feel like you're alone in this world
But you don't want to burden anyone else
You try to keep it all inside
But it's getting harder and harder to hide

Chorus
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
You want to tell someone but you can't find the words
Your heart is aching, it's tearing you apart
But you're too shy to say it

Prompt: write bee movie enemies to lovers fanfiction

Response:

Once upon a time, there was a bee named Barry B. Benson who lived in the hive of Honey Valley. He was a hard worker and a loyal bee, but he had a secret dream of one day leaving the hive to explore the world outside.

One day, Barry ventured out of the hive and found himself in the middle of a battle between two rival bee colonies. In the midst of the chaos, he met a fierce female bee named Vanessa. The two of them quickly became enemies, fighting fiercely against each other.

But as the battle raged on, Barry and Vanessa began to realize that they had more in common than they had initially thought. Despite their differences, they were both fiercely loyal to their colonies and were willing to do whatever it took to protect them.

Slowly, Barry and Vanessa's animosity began to fade away. They started to become friends, and eventually, their friendship blossomed into a passionate romance.

And so, Barry and Vanessa's enemies-to-lovers story was born. They eventually married and settled in the hive of Honey Valley, where they raised their own family of little bees.

The moral of the story is that even the most unlikely of enemies can become the best of friends and lovers.
